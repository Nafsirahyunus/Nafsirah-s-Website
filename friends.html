        <div class="desc">Allow me to present Nur Athirah, my closest friend. Since we first met in 2015 at the age of 12 years old, she and I have been inseparable. We've had countless adventures together, helped one another through both good and bad experiences, and made priceless memories over the years. Every moment spent with [Best Friend's Name], from going on exciting outings and food hunts to our usual karaoke session, has been priceless. Mutual respect, understanding, and an unbreakable tie that has gotten stronger over time are the foundations of our friendship. We will have many more years of laughing and life experiences together, and I am very appreciative of her constant support and friendship.</div>

        <div class="desc">My group of friends, known as SLAY, has been a constant source of happiness and encouragement in my life since we were 14 years old in 2017. Since the beginning of our journey in elementary school, we have shared many life milestones, from the awkwardness of our teenage years to the exhilarating experiences of high school. SLAY has consistently provided comfort and joy throughout it all. We've grown older together, laughed together, cried together, and faced adolescence's obstacles together. Every individual inside SLAY brings something unique to the group, and their mutual respect, trust, and understanding have strengthened their friendship over time. Thank you so much for always being there for me, SLAY. I look forward to many more years of giggles and adventures together.</div>

        <div class="desc">For all of us, our meeting in Form 4 was a turning point. We discovered each other in the midst of overwhelming academic pressure and an uncertain future, and we swiftly grew close as a supportive group. We had innumerable moments of heartfelt chats, late-night study sessions, and laughs. We enjoyed hanging out after school together, participated in school events, and overcame the difficulties of exams. Because of our common experiences, we developed a closer relationship over time that made our friendship feel more like a family.</div>

        <div class="desc">I had the privilege of making a close-knit group of friends throughout my time in STPM, and they have grown to be a big part of my life. We became close because we had similar struggles and experiences with our education, and we helped one another get through the difficult homework and nerve-wracking tests. From late-night study sessions to celebration outings after exams, we created many memories together. Each friend contributed special talents and viewpoints to the group, fostering a vibrant and encouraging atmosphere. Our STPM journey has been made more delightful by this friendship, which is based on respect, understanding, and common goals. It has also created enduring bonds that I value greatly. I am so appreciative of their friendship and am looking forward to many more accomplishments and experiences together in the future.</div>
